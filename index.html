                I was born in Madison, Wisconsin on July 7, 1992 but was raised in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, a small town about 25 miles southwest of Madison.  I grew up way out in the country and worked on farms until I was 14, when I got a job cooking in a small Italian restaraunt.  After graduating high school, I moved to Madison to attend college at University of Wisconsin.
                In 2013, I decided to put off school and moved to Longmont, Colorado because I have always loved the mountains. After a year of living in Longmont and cooking at a brewery, I moved to Boulder and started a landscaping and property maintenance job. In 2017, I took 5 months off, built a camper van and traveled all over the west coast. The trip was an amazing experience but
                once winter set in, I returned to Colorado to start a new career in web development.

                I have many hobbies I do in my free time.  I love music and enjoy seeing contcerts at Red Rocks and other local venues.  I have played guitar and bass for about ten years and also dable in recording and electronic production.
                I also love food.  I enjoy cooking any type of food and creating new dishes and recipes. I also like to eat out and try new food to get ideas for my own meals.  Really though, most of my hobbies are outdoors.
                I garden, hike, fish, mountain bike, ski, and disc golf regularly but enjoy doing most anything outside. I also love all animals and consider myself both a dog and a cat person.
