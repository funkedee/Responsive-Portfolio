                    I was born in Madison, Wisconsin on July 7, 1992 but was raised in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, a small
                    town about 25 miles southwest of Madison. I grew up way out in the country and worked on farms
                    until I was 14, when I got a job cooking in a small Italian restaraunt. After graduating high
                    school, I moved to Madison to attend college at University of Wisconsin.
                    In 2013, I decided to put off school and moved to Longmont, Colorado because I have always loved
                    the mountains. After a year of living in Longmont and cooking at a brewery, I moved to Boulder and
                    started a landscaping and property maintenance job. In 2017, I took 5 months off, built a camper
                    van and traveled all over the west coast. The trip was an amazing experience but
                    once winter set in, I returned to Colorado to start a new career in web development.

                    I have many hobbies I do in my free time. I love music and enjoy seeing contcerts at Red Rocks and
                    other local venues. I have played guitar and bass for about ten years and also dable in recording
                    and electronic production.
                    I also love food. I enjoy cooking any type of food and creating new dishes and recipes. I also like
                    to eat out and try new food to get ideas for my own meals. Really though, most of my hobbies are
                    outdoors.
                    I garden, hike, fish, mountain bike, ski, and disc golf regularly but enjoy doing most anything
                    outside. I also love all animals and consider myself both a dog and a cat person.
